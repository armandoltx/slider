# Introduction

As a part of my training in JavaScript to improve mi skills, I decide to write code everyday and publish it on GitHub.

Today I am uploading a slider. It is a simple and responsive slider

## Goals

- Create an slider where the images are responsive.
- Improve my programming skills using CSS, HTML and JavaScript in the application.
- Build an application that I can reuse in my next projects.

## Approach

First, I thought I should use css classes to create the slider, and just use JavaScript and jQuery to add and remove the classes, but I changed the approach and I decided to add the properties using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS, Sass
- JavaScript
- jQuery.
